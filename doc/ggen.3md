# DESCRIPTION

The GGen library provides an implementation of several random dag generators used
in scheduling research. Along with these generators, a collection of analysis and
utility fonctions are provided.

The graph data structure comes from the [Igraph][] library.
Random Number Generators come from [GSL][].

## Generation Functions

All generation function take as argument a random number generator _r_ from GSL. This
generator must be initialized before the function call.

+ `ggen_generate_erdos_gnm()`

	Generates a DAG having _n_ nodes and _m_ edges. Edges are selected all at once among
	all the possible edges of a DAG.

	This is very similar to the *G(n,m)* random graph model but only edges that are
	valid in a DAG are taken into account.

+ `ggen_generate_erdos_gnp()`

	Generates a DAG having _n_ nodes. Each possible edges of the DAG is tested for inclusion 
	(with a *Bernouilli trial*) with probability _p_.

	This is very similar to the *G(n,p)* random graph model but, again, only edges valid
	in a DAG are taken into account.

+ `ggen_generate_erdos_lbl()`

	Generates a DAG having _n_ nodes and _nbl_ levels. A level is defined as a
	group of nodes that cannot share an edge. Nodes are dispatched uniformly inside
	_nbl_ levels before applying the *erdos G(n,p)* algorithm with probability _p_.

+ `ggen_generate_fifo()`

	Generates a DAG having at least _n_ nodes using a *Fan-in/Fan-out* algorithm.
	Starting with a single node, this function alternates (with equal probability)
	between *expansion* phases where new nodes are added to a node having few
	outgoing edges, and *contraction* phases where a random number of heavy nodes
	are given the same child.

	Be aware that the _od_ (maximum outdegree) has a lot of influence on the graph
	structure (way more than _id_ (maximum indegree).

+ `ggen_generate_random_orders()`

	Generates a DAG having _n_ nodes and which partial order is the intersection
	of _orders_ total orders.

	Graph theory tells us that a DAG is a partial order. A partial order can be
	generated by intersecting any number of randomly generated total orders. This
	is exactly what this function does.

## Static Graphs

These functions generate task graphs derived from classical parallel algorithms.

+ `ggen_generate_cholesky()`

	Generates a graph corresponding to a blocked Cholesky decomposition, on
	a matrix of size _n_ by _n_ (in blocks).

+ `ggen_generate_fibonacci()`

	Generates the graph corresponding to the typical recursive fibonacci
	function. A _cutoff_ point can be provided to stop the recursion under
	a value.

+ `ggen_generate_forkjoin()`

	Generates a graph composed of _phases_ fork-joins. A fork creates
	_diameter_ nodes, the join is always a single node.

+ `ggen_generate_poisson2d()`

	Generates the graph corresponding to _iter_ iterations of the solving
	of a Poisson equation over the unit square, split into a grid of _n_ by
	_n_ evenly spaced points. Each task works of a block of _n_ points.

+ `ggen_generate_sparselu()`

	Generates the graph corresponding an LU decomposition of a square
	matrix _size_ blocks wide.

+ `ggen_generate_strassen()`

	Generates the graph corresponding to a Strassen matrix multiply over a
	square matrix of _size_ by _size_ elements. Recursion is stopped at
	_depth_ or when the submatrix is smaller than _cutoff_.

## Analysis Functions

+ `ggen_analyze_longest_path()`

	Computes the longest path in _g_. Returns it as a vector containing the nodes of the path in order.

+ `ggen_analyze_longest_antichain()`

	Computes the longest antichain of g. Returns it as a vector containing the nodes of the chain (no specific order).

+ `ggen_analyze_lowest_single_ancestor()`

	Computes the lowest single ancestor of all vertices of g. Returns it as vector, where v(i) is the lsa of vertex id i (in igraph).

## Tranformation Functions

Transformation functions have a *type* parameter: _t_. This parameter change the goal of the transformations.

+ `ggen_transform_add()`

	Either a single source to the DAG _g_ or a single sink.

+ `ggen_transform_delete()`

	Either delete all sources of the DAG _g_ or all sinks.

# NOTES

Functions returning a `igraph_t *` should call `igraph_destroy` before `free`ing the pointer.

You are responsible for the quality of the random number generator given to the
generation functions. Be aware that the default RNG used by the GSL might not be appropriate.
